# TreeHouse Project1
 
 This simple web app is a simple quote generator: each time the "show another quote" button is clicked,
 a quote is generated. Other information includes the author/source of the quote, and (in some cases) the 
 citation and year from which the quote orginated. 

 HTML, CSS and the JS script are provided.
